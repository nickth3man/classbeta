### 1. Project Breakdown  
**App Name:** Academic Organizer Desktop  
**Platform:** Desktop Application (Windows, macOS, Linux)  
**Summary:**  
Academic Organizer Desktop is a modern, locally-installed platform designed to help university students manage their courses, assignments, and academic materials efficiently. The app provides a centralized dashboard for tracking deadlines, organizing files, and visualizing progress across multiple courses. Built with a focus on usability and performance, the app leverages local storage and file system integration to streamline academic workflows.  

**Primary Use Case:**  
The primary use case is for university students to manage their academic workload. Users can create courses, upload syllabi, track assignments, and receive deadline alerts. The app also automatically categorizes academic materials (e.g., lecture notes, readings) based on course metadata, ensuring a seamless organization system.  

**Authentication Requirements:**  
- Local user profiles with optional password protection.  
- Data encryption for sensitive information.  
- Profile-based settings and preferences.

### 3. Core Features  
1. **Course Creation with Syllabus Parsing:**  
   - Users can upload syllabi in PDF format, and the app extracts key details (e.g., course name, assignment deadlines).  
   - Automatically creates a course structure with assignments and materials.  

2. **Assignment Tracking with Deadline Alerts:**  
   - Native desktop notifications for upcoming deadlines.  
   - Visual progress tracking with completion metrics.  

3. **Adaptive File Organization System:**  
   - Files are automatically categorized based on course metadata (e.g., lecture notes, readings).  
   - Drag-and-drop interface for manual organization.  

4. **Dashboard with Calendar Integration:**  
   - Centralized view of all courses, assignments, and deadlines.  
   - Calendar view with color-coded events for each course.  
   - Optional integration with system calendar.  

5. **Course-Specific Views:**  
   - Detailed breakdown of assignments, materials, and completion status.  
   - Progress charts and analytics for each course.  

6. **Dialog-Based Forms with Real-Time Validation:**  
   - Forms for adding courses, assignments, and materials with instant feedback.  
   - Error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., missing fields, incorrect file types).

### 4. User Flow  
1. **Application Launch:**  
   - User opens the application and selects their profile or creates a new one.  
   - Redirected to the main dashboard or onboarding screen for new users.  

2. **Course Creation:**  
   - User uploads a syllabus or manually inputs course details.  
   - App parses the syllabus and creates a course structure.  

3. **Assignment Tracking:**  
   - User adds assignments with deadlines.  
   - App sends desktop notifications as deadlines approach.  

4. **File Organization:**  
   - User imports academic materials, which are automatically categorized.  
   - User can manually reorganize files if needed.  

5. **Dashboard Interaction:**  
   - User views their calendar, upcoming deadlines, and course progress.  
   - User can drill down into course-specific views for detailed insights.  

6. **Application Exit:**  
   - User exits the application, and data is automatically saved locally.

### 5. Design and UI/UX Guidelines  
- **Color Scheme:**  
  - Primary: Blue (#2563EB) for actionable items (e.g., buttons, links).  
  - Secondary: Gray (#6B7280) for neutral elements (e.g., text, borders).  
  - Accent: Green (#10B981) for success states (e.g., completed assignments).  

- **Typography:**  
  - Headings: Roboto (Bold, 24px).  
  - Body Text: Roboto (Regular, 16px).  

- **Layout:**  
  - Dashboard: Grid layout with cards for courses and assignments.  
  - Course View: Two-column layout (left: materials, right: assignments).  

- **Accessibility:**  
  - High contrast mode for visually impaired users.  
  - Keyboard shortcuts for common actions.  
  - Scalable UI elements for different screen sizes.
